# MinstClassification-
Simple neural network Image Classification task using Keras and Tensorflow 

This code trains a simple feedforward neural network on the MNIST dataset:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Images are loaded, reshaped, normalized, and labels are one-hot encoded.
Model Building: A neural network with two hidden layers and an output layer for classification is built.
Model Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data to measure performance.
